If you are going to learn one language (something everyone should do!), Python would be a great choice.\n","\n","From this language, other languages, features and packages have been created: Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and others that we will be using during this course.

It is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\n","\n","- Language: The Jupyter Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python.\n","\n","- Sharing: Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.\n","\n","- Widgets (apps): Code can produce rich output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript. Interactive widgets can be used to manipulate and visualize data in realtime.\n","\n","\n","- Moving to Enterprise platforms: Enterprise platforms such as Databricks provide notebook functionality for data scientists, developers, product managers, etc., to collaborate on projects and products.  This notebook functionality is essentially jupyter notebooks, with some proprietary twists.\n","\n","Jupyter notebooks are made up of **cells.**  There are two basics types of entries in a Jupyter notebook: **text cells** for comments, and **code cells** (commands). You can edit a cell by double clicking on it. You can run a code cell by pressing the \"Play\" button (▶) in the upper left corner of the code cell, and you can also stop it with the \"square\" ◼︎ . Try it now!  Doubleclick this cell.  You'll likely see the text markup language in the left pane, and the formatted text in the right.\n","\n","\n","For more details on the Jupyter Notebook, please see the Jupyter website http://jupyter.org/\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W9fg_nSyR9Ad"},"source":["## Text cells in a Jupyter notebook"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MGN7oQe6R9Ae"},"source":["To write text in a cell we select the cell and go to the toolbar to change it from \"code\" to \"text\" (it is actually in **Markdown**, a formatting language for making text look more fancy).

In a code cell, we can type any Python commands, running them by clicking \"Play\" in the braces ([ ]) upper-left corner of the code cell (see the next cell for example). When we \"play\" a cell, the code in it is executed and it returns whatever is the result of running a code.\n","\n","We build our jupyter notebooks with successive code cells, often interspersed with notes, images, and so on.  Because of this, it is important to think of your notebook as a whole, and not just the individual cells.\n","\n","Importantly, the results of running a cell are \"remembered\" for subsequent cells, as long as the session continues running.  Usually the session keeps running as long as you don't stop your computing \"instance\" and you keep the notebook window open.  Sometimes when you get errors in running your cells, it's because something from a prior cell was forgotten for some reason.  If you look above under the dropdown menus above, you'll see that there are options for clearing your outputs (in Edit), rerunning all the cells (in Runtime), etc.\n","\n","For example, in the following cell, it will remember that the **_VARIABLE_** called \"x\" is  the sum of two given numbers.  Once you run that cell, variable \"x\" will be available for use in cells below. Please select it and press the ▶ button to run it.  Then select the following cell and run it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"p8BvktOkR9Af"},"outputs":[],"source":["x = 5 + 5\n","print (\"The value of the 'x' variable is \" + str(x) + \".\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GFd6vC28R9Ag"},"outputs":[],"source":["print(\"The value of the 'x' variable is *still* \" + str(x) + \" down here.\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a7YDlrocR9Ag"},"source":["Go back to those two cells and change some things and then rerun them.\n","\n","_Note_: Instead of having to manually go and click the \"Play\" button every time, you can also run a cell with your keyboard (*much easier!*). Just press **Ctrl + Enter** or **Shift + Enter**. Experiment with both of those to see what the difference is.\n","\n","Again, since it's important, IPython notebooks flow from **top to bottom**. This means that if a cell relies on a variable or function that was created earlier in the notebook, you must run the prior cell to make that information available in future cells  (_we cannot just call \"x\" in other cell if we don't run this one before_)! Try restarting and clearing all outputs (from the Runtime and Edit menus above), and then just run that last cell.

The program code is just text defining commands in certain programming language (e.g. Python). Often scripts cobble other commands into something useful that can be run again and again.\n","\n","As with other files on a computer, we identify the type of a script based on the extension of the file. Typically this extension identifies programming language that was used to develop the script, with each language having been assigned a conventional extension. For example, a file called \"script_example.py\" is a file with python commands, and a file called \"script_example.R\" is a file with the R language commands. Other extensions that might be encountered include: \".cpp\", \".scala\", \".php\", \".rb\", \".sh\".\n","\n","\n","This is how you save the file as file.py to be able to run the file later.\n","\n","![NewText](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pearl-yu/foster_2022fall/2022-master/Module0_Basics/images/saveaspy.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Why do we need scripts? For one, we often want to create code that we will use frequently. Instead of writing all that code repeatedly in many notebooks, we can create a script and just call it. Often times, we want to write routines that are used by other, more complex systems, or by automated control software. You will see examples of how to do this later!\n","\n","Note that there are plenty of other more powerful text editors that provide other tools to boost productivity. Jupyter is convenient and easy to use, but if you've got a lot of code to write, you may consider [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/2).
