    "For more customizable string creation and printing, python also includes rich formatting capability that may be familiar to developers of other high-level programming language. Some examples are below. In a nutshell, one adds placeholders to the string being constructed. These placeholders always start with a `%` followed by some additional information that determines how the data will be formatted. After the string, another `%` is used, followed by the acutal data that is to be inserted in the prior placeholders. The full capabilities of python string formatting are beyond the scope of this primer, for more info, please consult the [offical documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting)."

    "- [Codecademy's Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). Working though this class will give you a _great_ foundation for Python.\n",
    "- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B009NLMB8Q/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) was the book that Prof. Foster suggested to prior iterations of this course. You can take a look at the chapters: Preliminaries, Introductory Examples (e.g. \"Counting Time Zones with pandas”), IPython (page 46 to 62) and specially, Pandas--one of the main Python packages for data analysis.  We will work with Pandas in class.\n",
    "- [Pandas Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Pandas-Cookbook-Scientific-Computing-Visualization/dp/1784393878) is another great resource to learn Pandas. It has lots of practice problems with detailed solutions in IPython notebooks.\n",

    "If you are ever stuck just remember: it is normal. This is actually how professional programmers work every day. Google is your best friend. `stackoverflow`, a popular programming question and answer site, has an extremely rich repository of solutions to problems that people have encountered, and many capable participants provide answers to those mysterious and rare problems that have not been addressed before. Just remember to look thoroughly before you ask! \n",

    "Finally, programming is a creative process- it can't be brute forced. It's natural to get stuck or frustrated from time to time, even with the incredible resources that are now available. Imagine an author trying to find the perfect paragraph to describe a character. In these situations, I like to go for a walk, listen to some music, or get some exercise. Anything to clear my head. From experience, many seemingly hard programming problems have become solvable only after introducing some fresh perspective, and being stuck while beating your head on the keyboard just isn't fun. "
